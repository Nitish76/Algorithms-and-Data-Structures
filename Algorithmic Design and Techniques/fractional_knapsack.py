''' A thief finds much more loot than his bag can fit. Help him to find the most valuable combination
of items assuming that any fraction of a loot item can be put into his bag.'''

''' Task: The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem'''
''' Input format: The first line of the input contains the number n of items and the capacity W of a knapsack.
The next n lines define the values and weights of the items. The i-th line contains integers vi and wiâ€”the
value and the weight of i-th item, respectively.'''

''' Constraints: 1 <=n <= 10^3, 0<= W <= 2*10^6, 0<= vi <= 2*10^6, 0<= wi <= 2*10^6
                all numbers are integers'''
